Comput_R_T_poro_poro.m computes the Reflection/Transmission (R/T) coefficients of different angles at an interface that separate two different porous media.

Comput_R_T_elastic_poro.m computes the Reflection/Transmission (R/T) coefficients of different angles at an interface that separate an elastic medium and a porous medium.
